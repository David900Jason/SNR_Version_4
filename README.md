# SNR Certificate

This is an HTML/CSS template used to develop the skill of coding web projects for a real company just in case we started working on a freelancing gig or got that task.

I also wanna mention that it was the only project that got over 2 versions, as well as it being the first website I designed, built and deployed.

**I learned:**
- Sass good writing principles
- How to use bootstrap effectively
- How to deploy a website
- How to organize my website
- How to design a webpage
- How to choose a color palette

## Figma

I used **Figma** for design and also I added those design files in the design folder.
I added a mobile responsive part as well.

### Font Family
- **Open sans**
I chose a sans-serif font to add simplcity and smooth appeal to the design.
I also self-hosted this font-family to avoid internet connection conflicts
